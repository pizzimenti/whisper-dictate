# Changelog

## 0.8.2 — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Chromium/Wayland text insertion regression.** Dictated text was not
  inserted into Chrome text fields; the preedit status animation
  ("Transcribing...") was left in the field instead.
  - Swap commit/clear ordering so `commit_text` arrives before the preedit
    clear. On the Wayland text-input-v3 path each IBus call becomes a
    separate protocol batch; clearing first caused Chrome to finalize the
    animation text.
  - Stop discarding deferred text when the daemon transitions to idle.
    Chrome on Wayland sends spurious focus-out events during transcription;
    the final transcript was deferred correctly but then thrown away before
    focus returned.
  - Always commit deferred text on focus return regardless of daemon state.
  - Remove redundant `hide_preedit_text()` call from the render adapter;
    `update_preedit_text_with_mode(visible=False)` is sufficient and avoids
    an extra signal that Chrome could misinterpret.
